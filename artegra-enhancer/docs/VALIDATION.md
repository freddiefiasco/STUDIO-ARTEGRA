# Release validation

## Completed

- 331 tests plus 33 subtests passed on a separate Windows node; no failures or skips. Coverage includes model download/resume/cancellation, integrity, output preservation, crash recovery, authentication, queue behaviour and diagnostics.
- 203 targeted checks passed after removal of three unused external-node registrations. Image-processing functions and required graph nodes were unchanged.
- Selected Standard and Fast reference/pilot renders at 768×768 input and 1536×1536 output matched at zero differing pixels, cold and warm. Timing differences stayed within 5%.
- Original versus independently installed runtime comparisons also matched at zero differing pixels for selected Standard/Fast cold and warm renders.
- Completed GPU comparisons released owned processes and returned GPU memory to baseline within 15 seconds.
- Fresh runtime installation verified all 86 pinned dependency versions, source hashes, licence files and package consistency. The actual image-engine service started successfully.
- Frozen executable startup, model-consent gating, verification, diagnostic export, and source/binary privacy checks passed.

## Limits

GPU checks used RTX 5090 32 GB hardware and a representative render crop. They do not establish universal image/GPU compatibility. A 50-image simulated-engine batch was tested; no 50-image real-GPU or overnight endurance claim is made. The extended GPU batch was stopped at the owner's request to keep this release a lean refinement.

Numerical evidence is in `qa/source-parity.json` and `qa/runtime-parity.json`. Release assets carry SHA-256 checksums. No private test images, machine paths, credentials or original source history are distributed.
